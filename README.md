# Leaderboard
With the Leaderboard website the user can keep scores of a game by adding new entries and having an updated ordered rank. Once the score is submitted you can't remove it. However you can start a new leaderboard (or game) and store new scores from scratch. 
<br>
All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service. This is a project for learning purposes which I'll practice medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI.
