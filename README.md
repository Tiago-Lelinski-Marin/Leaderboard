# Leaderboard
The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service. This is a project for learning purposes which I'll practice medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI.

## Built With

- SCSS
- HTML
- JavaScript

## Live demo
You can access the live demo through this [link](https://tiago-lelinski-marin.github.io/Leaderboard/dist/index.html)

When you first open this app throught the live demo link you need to create a new game. To do that just type a name of your choice for the game and click on the button "new game", then just add your scores.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

- Clone this repo to your computer using git.
Or
- Download the compressed [zip folder](https://github.com/Tiago-Lelinski-Marin/Leaderboard/archive/refs/heads/dev.zip) and use a decompressor to unzip it into your computer. Then open the folder and all the project files will be there.

- then instal npm in with "npm install" and then **use "npm run see"** to open the application on your browser
